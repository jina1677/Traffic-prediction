# Traffic-prediction
Nowadays,the increase in the number of vehicles on the road has led
to a serious traffic congestion problem in modern cities .Traffic conges-
tion results in low throughput and excess delays,which deeply affect our
daily lives.The growing number of vehicles on streets increased traffic con-
gestion.Furthermore,idling vehicles caused by traffic jams will waste more
fuel.All these situations remind us of the importance of traffic manage-
ment,with which to optimize the traffic stream and public traffic choices of
citizens in smart cities. This project aims to develop a system for predict-
ing accurate traffic flow information. This system was implemented based
on two machine learning algorithms such as LSTM and GRU.This system
made the comparison study with respect to the GRU and LSTM.The result
obtained while using the GRU was better compared to LSTM.LSTM ob-
tained 7.097 MAE,93.554 MSE and 9.672 RMSE while GRU obtained 7.267
MAE,95.928 MSE and 9.794 RMSE.
